DESCRIPTION
-----------
Conduit is a job distrubtion system that provides an extremely flexible
platform that can be configured in a variety of ways to get the desired result.

The general building blocks of conduit are described below.

-- Client --
The client is the controller who decides what jobs are created and run, views
the results, and controls and configuration of jobs properties.

-- Worker --
The worker is responsible for completing jobs and reporting the results back to
the central conduit server.

-- Group --
A group is a generic container that can be used to build a tree structure that
can be either complex or simple depending on the needs for a particular
situation. Each group may have a set of properties which are recursively
aggregated to the groups bellow with presidence given the the deeper nested
group.

-- Job --
A job contains the instructions necessary to complete a task. Jobs must always
be nested in a group and will gain all the properties of the group to which it
belongs, but may override any of the properties or add new ones. Once a job has
been completed the result is stored and the job may be queued again. If a job
is run multiple times then the results are stored as revisions which can be
viewed to provide a history of the results for a particular job.
